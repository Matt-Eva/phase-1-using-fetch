## Introduction

When it comes to making engaging web sites, we often find ourselves needing to
send a lot of data (text, images, media, etc.) so that the page is exciting.

**But** browsers won't show anything until they've processed all of that data.
As a result, they show nothing. The screen stays blank and users experience
"waiting."

Too much waiting means visitors will click away and never come back. Web users
expect sites to load quickly **and** to stay updated. Research shows that 40
percent of visitors to a website will leave if the site takes more than 3
seconds to load. Mobile users are even _less_ patient.

To solve this problem and help provide lots of other really great features, we
developed a technique called **_AJAX_**. As mentioned at the beginning of this
module, AJAX is short for _Asynchronous JavaScript and XML_ (although we'll be
using JSON instead of XML).

In AJAX we:

1. Deliver an initial, engaging page using HTML and CSS which browsers render
   _quickly_
2. _Then_ we use JavaScript to add more to the DOM, behind the scenes

AJAX relies on several technologies:

- Things called `Promise`s
- Things called `XMLHttpRequestObject`s
- A [serialization format][sf] called JSON for "JavaScript Object Notation"
- [asynchronous Input / Output][asyncio]
- [the event loop][el]

It just so happens that modern browsers have _abstracted_ all those components
into a single function called `fetch()`.

While someone interviewing to be a front-end developer will be expected to be
able to explain all those components above (which we _will_ cover later), while
we're getting the hang of things, we're going to simplify our task by using
`fetch()`.

Let's learn to use `fetch()` to apply the AJAX technique: a way to load
additional data _after_ information is presented to the user.

## Explain How to Fetch Data with `fetch()`

The `fetch()` function retrieves data. It's a global _method_ on the `window`
object, provided to JavaScript by browsers' web APIs. That means you can use it
simply by calling `fetch()` and passing in a path to a resource as an argument.
To use the data that is returned by the `fetch()`, we need to chain on the
`then()` method. We can see what this looks like below:

```js
fetch("string representing a URL to a data source")
  .then(function (response) {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(function (data) {
    // Use the data from the response to do DOM manipulation
  });
```

When we write fetch requests in our JavaScript code, this is the form it will
often take - one call to our `fetch` method, followed by two `.then` statements.
Let's walk through each of these pieces of code step by step!

## Fetch Itself

Let's start off with the `fetch` function itself. What's it doing? How are we
using it?

As we discussed in previous sections, clients request data from servers and
servers send data to clients. This is the _request-response cycle_.

`fetch` is used to initiate that request-response cycle from our client-side
code to our servers. When we enter a Google search, for example, Google's
client-side code initiates a `fetch` request.

We use `fetch` by passing it a URL that points toward the server we want to
communicate with. We'll be mainly passing URLs pointing toward `localhost`
servers run by JSON Server, but we can pass it a URL pointing toward any API we
want to work with - this [Game of Thrones](https://anapioficeandfire.com/) API,
for example! When developing the Frontend for a Full Stack application, you'll
pass `fetch` the URL to your backend API.

```JavaScript
fetch("https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/books")
```

### Fetch is Asynchronous

We discussed JavaScript's asynchronous abilities in some of our previous
lessons. As a brief refresher, _asynchronous_ code is code that allows us to
start an operation in our code, then switch to running other pieces of code
while we wait for that operation to finish.

`fetch` is a prime example of asynchronous code in JavaScript! It's also
demonstrates how useful asynchronous programming is.

Thinking about making a web request - your computer is asking some remote server
for some information. You might be thousands of miles away from the server!

That server may then have to interact with a database to get the information
you've requested. Once the database has finished looking for the appropriate
data and giving it to the server, the server then has to send that data all the
way back to you.

That's a lot to do, and it takes a long time!

If our code had to wait for the server to respond with the data we're asking for
before moving on to other tasks, it could really slow down the performance of
our website. Code that halts other code from running is often called _blocking_
code - it blocks our code's ability to move on to other tasks.

Fortunately, because fetch uses asynchronous JavaScript, it is considered
_non-blocking_ - our code is free to move on to other tasks before our server
gives us a response!

For example, in the following code snippet, our `console.log` will run before
the we receive a response back from the server (we'll see this in greater detail
a little further down).

```JavaScript
fetch("https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/books")

console.log("I don't wait!")
```

## Our First .then

Ok, so we can keep doing stuff while waiting for our server to respond - neat.

But what about code that we want to run _after_ our server responds? What about
code that's supposed to actually _use_ that data? That's where our `.then`
statements come in.

### Promises

We're going to talk about this in more detail in a later section, but in order
to understand how `fetch` and `.then` statements work together, we need to talk
a little bit about _promises_.

A _promise_ is a piece of data that JavaScript generates when it kicks off an
asynchronous task.

Try adding the following code to your `index.js` file and opening your
`index.html` file in your browser:

```JavaScript
const myPromise = fetch("https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/books")

console.log(myPromise)
```

If you open up your browser console, you should see the following:
`PromiseÂ {<pending>}`.

Because our `fetch` request takes a while to complete, and because we want to
move on to other tasks, it generates this `Promise` object for us, which we can
use to determine when the fetch request finishes.

When Promises are first generated, they have a status of _pending_. That status
can either resolve to _fulfilled_, if the operation is successful, or
_rejected_, if the operation fails.

Once our fetch is complete, the status of this Promise object will change to
_fufilled_.

Let's make the following modification to our code:

```JavaScript
const myPromise = fetch("https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/books")

console.log(myPromise)

setTimeout(() =>{
    console.log(myPromise)
}, 1000)
```

We should now see a new, additional log in our browser console: `Promise
{<fulfilled>: Response}`. (If you don't see it, try increasing the time interval
in setTimeout.)

### Waiting for a Fulfilled Promise

Our `.then` statements are designed to wait for the Promise generated by `fetch` to be fulfilled. The code that we pass to a `.then` statement will only run _after_ the Promise has been fulfilled.

Now let's add some multi-line (`/*...*/`) comments (which JavaScript will
ignore) to describe what's happening:

```js
/*
  Here we are calling `fetch()` and passing a URL to a data source as the
  argument. The function call returns a Promise object that represents what the data
  source sent back. It does *not* return the actual content. (More about this
  later.)
*/
fetch("string representing a URL to a data source")
  /*
    Next, we call the `then()` method on the Promise object returned by calling
    `fetch()`. `then()` takes one argument: a callback function. 
    (More on Promises later!)
    
    Inside the callback function, we do whatever processing we need on the
    object, in this case, converting it from JSON using the built-in `json()`
    method. (Another commonly-used method is `text()`, which will convert the
    response into plain text.) The `json()` method returns a Promise, which we
    return from our callback function.
    
    Note that we *have to return* the content that we've gotten out of the
    response and converted from JSON in order to use the data in the next then()
    method call.

    This first callback function is usually only one line: returning the 
    content from the response after converting it into the format we need.
  */
  .then(function (response) {
    return response.json();
  })
  /*
    This time, the `then()` method is receiving the object that we returned from the
    first call to `then()` (our parsed JSON object). We capture the object in the
    parameter `data` and pass it into a second callback function, where we will
    write code to do DOM manipulation using the data returned from the server
  */
  .then(function (data) {
    // Use the actual data to do DOM manipulation
  });
```

> **Top Tip:** As always, we can name the parameters being used in our callback
> functions anything we like, but you will often see `response` (or `resp`) and
> `data` used.

### Filling Out the Example

Let's fill out our base skeleton.

First, we'll provide a `String` argument to `fetch()`. As it happens,
`http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json` will provide a list of the humans in
space. You can paste this URL into a browser tab and see that the data uses a
JSON structure.

JSON is a way to send a collection of data in the internet, formatted as a
`String`. It just so happens that this string is written in a way that would be
valid JavaScript syntax for an `Object` instance. Thus the name "JavaScript
Object Notation", or JSON ("jay-sawn"). Programmers find it very easy to think
about JavaScript `Object`s, so they often send "stringified" versions of
`Object`s as responses.

The `then()` method takes a callback function as an argument. Here is where you
tell JavaScript to parse the network response, which is formatted as a special
JSON string, into actual JavaScript objects. When you first start using
`fetch()`, most of your first `then()`s are going have a callback function that
looks like this:

```js
function(response) {
  // take the response, which is a JSON-formatted **string**,
  // and parse it into an actual JavaScript **object**
  return response.json();
}
```

The final `then()` is when you actually get some data (the parsed object
returned from the first `then()`) passed in. You can then do something with that
data. The easiest options are:

- `alert()` the data
- `console.log()` the data
- hand the data off to another function.

We'll go for the `console.log()` approach:

```js
function(data) {
  console.log(data)
}
```

> **STRETCH:** But you _should_ be able to imagine that you could do some DOM
> manipulation instead.

Here's a completed example:

```js
fetch("http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json")
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(function (data) {
    console.log(data);
  });
```

Let's perform a demonstration. Navigate to
[http://open-notify.org](http://open-notify.org) in an **incognito** tab. We
need to go incognito to make sure that none of your browsing history interferes
with this experiment.

Open up DevTools and paste the following into the console:

```js
fetch("http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json")
  .then(function (response) {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(function (data) {
    console.log(data);
    console.log(`Holy cow! There are ${data["number"]} humans in space.`);
  });
```

You might notice in the DevTools console that this chained method call returned
a `Promise`. We'll cover that later.

## Working Around Backwards Compatibility Issues

As you can see, `fetch()` provides us with a short way to fetch and work with
resources. In older code you might see `jquery.ajax` or `$.ajax` or an object
called an `XMLHttpRequestObject`. You might also see libraries like `axios` used
in newer code. These are distractions at this point in your education. After
working with `fetch()` you'll be able to more easily integrate these special
topics.

## Identify Examples of the AJAX Technique on Popular Websites

The AJAX technique opens up a lot of uses!

- It allows us to pull in dynamic content. The same "framing" HTML page remains
  on screen for a cooking website. The recipe on display updates _without_ page
  load. This approach was pioneered by GMail whose nav area is swapped for mail
  content swiftly â thanks to AJAX.
- It allows us to get data from multiple sources. We could make a website that
  displays the current weather forecast and the current price of bitcoin side by
  side! This approach is used by most sites to render ads. Your content loads
  while JavaScript gets the ad to show and injects it into your page (sometimes
  AJAX can be used in a way that we don't _entirely_ like).

## Conclusion

Many pages use AJAX to provide users fast and engaging sites. It's certainly not
required in all sites. In fact, using it could be a step backward if simple HTML
would suffice. However, as sites have more and more material, the AJAX technique
is a great tool to have.

Using `fetch()`, we can include requests for data wherever we need to in our
code. We can `fetch()` data on the click of a button or the expansion of an
accordion display. There are many older methods for fetching data, but `fetch()`
is the future.
